// Multithreading is a Java feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program
// Each part of such program is called a thread. So, threads are light-weight processes within a process.

// Threads can be created by using two mechanisms :
// 1. Extending the Thread class
// 2. Implementing the Runnable Interface

public class Multithreading {
    public static void main(String[] args){

        // Example for create thread use Extends Thread
        for(int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
            MultithreadingExtendsThread myThing = new MultithreadingExtendsThread(i);
            myThing.start();
        }

        // Example for create thread use Implements Runnable
        for(int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
            MultithreadingImplementsRunnable myThing = new MultithreadingImplementsRunnable(i);
            Thread myThread = new Thread(myThing);
            myThread.start();
        }

        // Thread Class vs Runnable Interface
        // 1. If we extend the Thread class, our class cannot extend any other class because Java doesnâ€™t support
        // multiple inheritance. But, if we implement the Runnable interface, our class can still extend other base
        // classes.
        // 2. We can achieve basic functionality of a thread by extending Thread class because it provides some
        // inbuilt methods like yield(), interrupt() etc. that are not available in Runnable interface.
        // 3. Using runnable will give you an object that can be shared amongst multiple threads.
